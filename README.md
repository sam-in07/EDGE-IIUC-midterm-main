What is a Hero Section?

A hero section is the large, prominent area at the top of a webpage — often the first thing users see when they land on a site. It's used to grab attention and usually contains:

A background image or video

A headline or main message

A call-to-action button (like “Sign Up” or “Learn More”)

Possibly a subheadline or some supporting text
